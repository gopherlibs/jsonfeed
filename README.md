# JSON Feed Go Library [![CI Status](https://circleci.com/gh/gopherlibs/jsonfeed.svg?style=shield)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/gopherlibs/jsonfeed) [![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gopherlibs/jsonfeed/master/LICENSE)

This is a library to parse and validate a JSON Feed.
JSON Feed is a modern alternative to RSS and Atom.
I'd recommend learning more about it at the [official website][jfeed] if you're unfamiliar.

**Note: This package is pre-1.0 thus the API is still changing as I prepare it for a v1.0 release.**


## Usage

Instructions coming soon.
For now, just look at the code.


## Development

This library is written and tested with Go v1.15+ in mind.
`go fmt` is your friend.
Please feel free to open Issues and PRs as you see fit.
Any PR that requires a good amount of work or is a significant change, it would be best to open an Issue to discuss the change first.
